DevOps PipeLine
+++++++++++++++

We are going to create a chain of Jenkins jobs to create DevOps Pipeline.
1. Jenkins Job 1 - Will build Custom Docker Image with a Dockerfile
2. Jenkins Job 2 - Will build a Maven based Java project inside a Docker Container that was provisioned on the fly at runtime with the Docker image that was builtby Jenkins Job 1.

Whenever we commit source into GiHub Repository, Jenkins Job 1 will detect the code change and will trigger the Docker Image build automatically

Once Jenkins Job 1 builds successfully it will trigger Jenkins Job 2.

This excersise will help to understand the below concepts
	1. Jenkins DevOps Pipeline
	2. Jenkins Master/Slave Node
	3. Docker Jenkins Plugin
