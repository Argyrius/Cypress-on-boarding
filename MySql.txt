We would like to store employee and their address details in a table.

Single Table (Employee)
	0.Employee ID ( Primary Key)
	1.Firstname
	2.Lastname
	3.Date Of Joining
	4.Designation
	5.Department
	6.Date of Birth

	7.Door no
	8.Street
	9.City
	10.Country
	11.Zipcode

Primary Key - is a field/attribute that helps retrieving a unique record out of the table
	    - every employee will have a unique employee id
	    -primary key is a mandatory field for every employee record
	    -typically primary key can't be null or empty


To avoid duplication of information, we would like to split the single table into 2 tables
	1.Employee
	2.Address

Employee Table
        0.Employee ID ( Primary Key) 	int	
        1.Firstname			VARCHAR	(50)
        2.Lastname			VARCHAR	(50)
        3.Date Of Joining		DateTime
        4.Designation			VARCHAR	(50)
        5.Department			VARCHAR	(50)
        6.Date of Birth			DateTime


Address Table
        0.Employee ID	(Foreign Key)
        1.Adress ID	(Primary Key)
	2.Door no	VARCHAR(5)
	3.Street	
	4.City
	5.Country	
	6.Zipcode
